I have been coding for 3 years now, starting with simple blocks and then moving forward to HTML, CSS, and JS! This continued for 2 years and I feel that I have some mastery in this and will be able to succeed in this class very much. I am also proficient in Flutter for App Development and I look forward to learning more programming to further enhance my skills.
