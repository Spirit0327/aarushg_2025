# Reflection on My First Website in AP Computer Science Principles

In our first assignment for AP Computer Science Principles (period 3), we were tasked with creating a basic website using Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks. Going into the project, I was excited but a bit unsure of how the process would unfold. I had some experience with coding, but working with Markdown in a notebook environment was new to me.

## The Process:
Markdown turned out to be a really efficient way to structure content. I appreciated how simple it was to format text with headers, lists, and links, without needing to dive into complicated HTML syntax. It allowed me to focus on the content and structure of my website rather than worrying too much about design elements.

Using Jupyter Notebooks was also an interesting experience. At first, I thought of Jupyter as more of a tool for coding and data science, but integrating it with Markdown made it a surprisingly effective tool for building simple, interactive websites. I especially liked being able to preview my changes right in the notebook as I worked, which made the process feel more dynamic.

## Challenges:
One of the main challenges I faced was figuring out how to balance the content and code in Markdown. I also needed to get comfortable switching between text formatting and adding elements like code blocks or links to make the website functional and easy to navigate. Another hurdle was learning how to display HTML properly inside Jupyter Notebooks, but I overcame that by using `IPython.display` to embed HTML content.

## What I Learned:
This project reinforced the importance of planning out a website’s structure before diving in. I learned how versatile Markdown can be, especially when combined with tools like Jupyter. It was rewarding to see how quickly I could create a functioning website using just a few lines of Markdown. 

I also gained a new appreciation for Jupyter Notebooks, as they can be used not just for coding, but for creating content-rich presentations or even basic websites. I now feel more confident in my ability to use Markdown and Jupyter together to build more complex projects in the future.

## Looking Forward:
I'm excited to see how we’ll build on this foundation in future assignments. This was a great introduction to the power of simple web development, and I can’t wait to explore more advanced techniques and tools as the course progresses.

# Reflection on Sprint 2 in AP Computer Science Principles!
Looking back at the past few weeks of learning both frontend and backend development, the student-led lectures were an effective way to break down complex topics like Python and JavaScript. The teaching segments followed by hands-on hacks allowed us to actively engage with the material and immediately apply it, which reinforced my thought processes.

## Teaching Experience Overview: 
We had to think on our feet to troubleshoot merge conflictions, and working together during the hands-on hack sessions, which boosted my confidence in both the technical and communication aspects of web development. Overall, teaching our peers made me more comfortable with the material and strengthened my teamwork skills. We completed 3.6 Conditionals and 3.7 Nested Conditionals, specifically, introducing Python conditions and worked on a mini quiz that involved the class participating and answering which was definetly a highlight of our presentation. I also learnt a lot of different topics such as Python Lists(3.10), De Morgan's Law(3.3), and more!

## How am I ready for the AP Exam?
My experience working on web development through these student-led lectures and hacks has definitely helped me prepare for the AP exam. Since I already had some prior experience with JavaScript and a bit of Python, I was able to build on that knowledge and get a deeper understanding of the concepts. Teaching the material with my group really reinforced what I knew. It forced me to break down complex topics and explain them in simple terms, which is a skill that will be important for College Board and Project Based Learning.
