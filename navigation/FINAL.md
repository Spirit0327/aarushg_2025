# TRI 3 FINAL BLOG - AARUSH

## N@TM TRI 2: Chess Analysis Platform

### Executive Summary:
I developed a comprehensive chess move analysis and management system for our chess-based social media platform. This full-stack feature enables users to upload PGN files, analyze their games using the Stockfish engine, and manage their chess moves through a complete CRUD interface with real-time evaluation feedback.

### Team Purpose:
Our team created Pawnsy, a chess social media platform where users discuss strategies, analyze games, and learn from each other. My feature provides the analytical backbone, allowing users to deeply examine their gameplay and save insights for future reference and community discussion.

### Individual Feature Overview:
The chess analysis system combines three core components: PGN file processing, Stockfish engine integration, and move management. Users can upload their game files, navigate through moves with arrow keys on an interactive board, and receive detailed evaluations including move classifications like "Brilliant," "Inaccurate," or "Blunder."

The system processes chess games by parsing PGN notation, feeding positions to the Stockfish engine for analysis, and storing evaluation data in a structured database. Users can then interact with this data through a dynamic interface that allows full CRUD operations on their stored moves.


## N@TM TRI 3: Pyre Risk Predictor

### Executive Summary:
For the third trimester, I developed the Risk Predictor feature for Pyre, our natural disaster safety platform. This system evaluates wildfire and earthquake risks for any U.S. ZIP code using real-time APIs and historical data, providing users with actionable safety insights through sophisticated risk assessment algorithms.

### Team Purpose:
Pyre helps individuals and communities understand natural disaster threats through data-driven analysis. My Risk Predictor feature gives users immediate risk assessments to make informed decisions about where to live, work, or travel based on comprehensive natural disaster risk profiles.

### Individual Feature Overview:
The Risk Predictor accepts ZIP code inputs and generates comprehensive risk evaluations for both wildfires and earthquakes. The system calculates risk scores from 0-100 using multiple data sources including recent disaster activity, geographical factors, and environmental conditions.

The wildfire risk assessment considers recent fire activity patterns, vegetation density levels, and seasonal weather conditions specific to the geographic region. The algorithm weighs recent incidents more heavily than historical data to provide current risk assessments that reflect changing environmental conditions.

The earthquake risk evaluation incorporates historical seismic activity, maximum recorded magnitudes, and proximity to major fault lines using precise geographical distance calculations. The system applies the Haversine formula to determine fault line proximity and combines this with frequency analysis of recent seismic events.


## FINAL REVIEW & REFLECTION

### Achievements:
1. **Stockfish Integration**: Successfully implemented professional chess engine analysis with real-time evaluation feedback and move classification
2. **Full-Stack Development**: Created complete CRUD systems with seamless frontend-backend integration across multiple projects
3. **Deployment Mastery**: Mastered AWS EC2, Route 53, Docker containerization, and SSL certificate management for production deployment
4. **API Development**: Built RESTful APIs with comprehensive error handling, validation, and external service integration



### User Feedback Analysis:
From 22 N@TM responses, users consistently praised the clean interface design, sophisticated Stockfish integration, and comprehensive move analysis capabilities. The interactive chess board with arrow key navigation received particularly positive feedback for its intuitive user experience.
